==========================

## Overview

The Chart Search Module provides an extension to the core application patient search. 
The module takes advantage of the Apache SOLR search server to index and filter more 
detailed patient data given precise search keywords.

## Installation

There are multiple options to install the Chart Search Module. A user may setup or run a 
pre-existing OpenMRS Reference Application, which will run all other dependent modules, 
and then upload (or perform a normal OpenMRS module installation on) Chart Search. Alternatively,
the user may wish to download OpenMRS 2.2+ which includes the Chart Search Module by default. 
An [.omod can be found here](https://modules.openmrs.org/#/show/164/chart-search-module).
